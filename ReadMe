# udacity landing page 

this project is about landing page consisting of 4 sections

[1] => on the navigation item , the item scroll you to the appropriate section.
    => i do it by html using href and id.

[2] => functionality added when index.html is loaded in the browser.
    => i do it using DOMContentLoaded event in the start of js file.

[3] => there are three files (index.html file , styles.css file and app.js file).

[4] => the web page is responsive in all devices without using any libraries.

[5] => navigation is build dynamically as unordered list that is empty and i complete it by javascript.
    => i did it by using function addLi() and for loop by createElement and appendChild as i create li and 
    a element and then put them all in ul, i also create an id , href and class attribute for all of them.

[6] => i added a active class to navigation items when a section is in the viewport using getBoundingClientRect    
    property , if the top is equal 0 it means that the section in the viewport and i added active class and so on.

[7] => i made the fixed navigation bar hide while not scrolling by using pageYoffset and scrollTop to determine 
    the current scroll to know if the user scroll the page or not .. if there is a scroll it means that the current distance to top is more than the previous distance to top so i transfer the navbar untill it fadeOut.

[8] => add scroll to top button that only visible when i scroll down using scrollTop that made its value equal 0
    it means that i am in the top of the page.

[9] => i also changed the color of the navbar when i scrolled down to sections to fit the color of the background.
